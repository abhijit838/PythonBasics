An introduction to python.

How python runs codes:

   Python is a scripting language. That means all the python codes are interpreted by a software package called python interpreter. But if we want   to dig a little bit more inside then we will see some interasting things. Python software package has a compiler and PVM(Python Virtual Machine).Internally the almost hidden from you. First it compiles your  source codes(statements) into a intermidiate code called byte code then interpreter reads it and runs on PVM. If python process has permission to write file in your system then you an see a file with extension with xxx.pyc(byte code file).  Other wise compiler will write the byte code file in your system memory. Purpose of byte code is to speed up your enter process(no need to compile again untill you change the source code) and to make it system independent.
   One more interasting thing is that if have compiled file then no need to think about python version. It will put a version tag inside your byte code and it will covert your byte code to new byte code compatible to new virsion.
   
How we run codes:

  If you have installed python in your system and already done with path variable setup then in terminal(unix/linux/mac) or command prompt(windows) just type python. It will give you a n interactive python shell session with ">>>" . Then you can write your python code. Or you can write a py file like 'hello.py' ,and run  in terminal , command like>: >>>python  [/file path][/filename.py].
  
Lets start with small small codes snipate directly from python shell:

  Road Map: 

    Inbuilt data types.
    Basic math operations.
    Working with Numbers, String, List, Touple, Set, Dictionary.
    Condition and conditional operators, nested condition.
    Iteration with while and for.
    More in iteration with breaks and continue.
    Function
    Some inbuilt functions.
    Module import and reload.
    File handaling.
    Exception.
    Object oriented concepts
    Reg Exp
    Date operations
    Database access
    XML/JSON handaling
    Numeric data handaling with NumPy.
    --------------------------------------
    If possible then algorithms like linear, nonlinear data structures.
